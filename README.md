# Introduction & Aims
 The application provides a standard calculator functionality and was created to utilise the language of JavaScript. 
<br>
<br>
The application is for educational purposes.

## Aims
- To create application with HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript interactivity
- To create responsive design for accessibility on all devices
- To use application for quick and easy calculations
<br />
<br />
# User Experience
## User Stories
### As a first time visitor, I want to:
-  be able to easily make mathematical calculations
-  delete a mistyped digit easily
<br />

### As a returning visitor, I want to:
- be able to explore a scientific functionality of the application
- have an indication of the operations’ history
- be able to save a calculation with a name and view or edit it later
- be able to change it to dark mode 
<br />
<br />

# Features
## Design
Basic calculator design was utilised to create the application
<br />
<br />

## Wireframes
![Index Wireframe](assets/images/wireframe.png) 

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud/) has been used to create a wireframe to demonstrate the application.

<br />
<br />

## Features

![The screen.](assets/images/features.png)

<br />

The main screen of a basic calculator that can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication and division calculations. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, clear and equals buttons differ in colour to the numbers buttons.

<br />
<br />


## User Interactivity
### Buttons
![Buttons](assets/images/buttons.png)
<br />

All the buttons are clickable and hoverable. The buttons act as intended. On click the number or the calculated result appears on the screen. No mistakes have been found in calculated results of numerous calculations when adding, subtracting, multiplying or dividing.
<br />
<br />

## Future Developments
The given application has a significant developmental potential in features and functionality. 
In particular:
- addition of a scientific functionality to the application
- operations’ history to be displayed
- possibility to save a calculation with a name and view or edit it later
- possibility to use dark mode
- addition of unit conversion
<br />

# Testing
## Manual Testing 

**User and Design Expectation**
- The buttons are clearly designed for their purpose.
<br/>

**Testing** 
 - The buttons act as intended. On click the number or the calculated result appears on the screen. 
 <br/>

### Responsiveness
**User and Design Expectation**
- To be able to use the calculator on any device and screen size
- For the site to maintain its structural design in different screen sizes
<br/>

**Testing**
- Chrome Dev Tools was the primary tool for testing responsiveness throughout the development
- Responsiveness was additionally tested in Safari, Firefox, and Edge browers, and using [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive), the [Responsive Design Checker](https://www.responsivedesignchecker.com/) and [live.Browserstack](https://live.browserstack.com/)
