# Introduction & Aims
 The application provides a standard calculator functionality and was created to utilise the language of JavaScript. 
<br>
<br>
This application is for educational purposes.

## Aims
- To create application with HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript interactivity
- To utilise functional and simple design concepts for an easy-to-navigate UX
- To create responsive design for accessibility on all devices
- To use application for quick and easy calculations
<br />
<br />

# User Experience
## User Stories
### As a first time visitor, I want to:
-  be able to easily make mathematical calculations
-  delete a mistyped digit easily
<br />

### As a returning visitor, I want to:
- be able to explore a scientific functionality of the application
- have an indication of the operations’ history
- be able to save a calculation with a name and view or edit it later
- be able to change it to dark mode 
<br />
<br />
<br />

# Main Features
## Design
Basic calculator design was utilised to create the application
<br />
<br />

## Wireframes
![Index Wireframe](assets/images/wireframe.png) 

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud/) has been used to create a wireframe to demonstrate the application.

<br />

## Features

![The main screen.](assets/images/features.png)


<br />

The main screen of a basic calculator that can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication and division calculations. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, clear and equals buttons differ in colour to the numbers buttons.

<br />
<br />


## User Interactivity
### Buttons
![Buttons](assets/images/buttons.png)
<br />

All the buttons are clickable and hoverable.
<br />
<br />

## Future Developments
The given application has a significant developmental potential in features and functionality. 
In particular:
- addition of a scientific functionality to the application
- operations’ history to be displayed
- possibility to save a calculation with a name and view or edit it later
- possibility to use dark mode or night light (use warmer colours to help blocj blue light) 
- addition of unit conversion
<br />
<br />

# Technologies
Languages used in this site are [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5), [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS#CSS_3) and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript).

Additional technologies include: 
- [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)
   - Debugging and testing responsiveness during development
- [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)
    - Code checking and debugging
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)

- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)
  - Online IDE for all coding work and site file management, terminal was used to add, commit, and push to Github
<br />
<br />

# Testing
## Manual Testing 

**User and Design Expectation**
- The buttons are clearly designed for their purpose.
<br/>

**Testing** 
 - The buttons act as intended. On click the number or the calculated result appears on the screen. 
 <br/>

### Responsiveness
**User and Design Expectation**
- To be able to use the calculator on any device and screen size
- For the site to maintain is structural design in different screen sizes
<br/>

**Testing**
-  Chrome Dev Tools was the primary tool for testing responsiveness throughout development
- Responsiveness was additionally tested in Safari, Firefox, and Edge browers, and using [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) and the [Responsive Design Checker](https://www.responsivedesignchecker.com/)
