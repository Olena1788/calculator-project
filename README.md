## User Stories
### As a first time visitor, I want to:
-  be able to easily make mathematical calculations
-  delete a mistyped digit easily
<br />

### As a returning visitor, I want to:
- be able to explore a scientific functionality of the application
- have an indication of the operations’ history
- be able to save a calculation with a name and view or edit it later
- be able to change it to dark mode 
<br />
<br />
